# Frontend Documentation

This folder contains architecture and process docs for the Nuxt frontend (`fronted/`).

## Scope

- Current focus is admin area implementation.
- Public pages are present but documented only where they affect shared infrastructure.

## Sections

- `architecture.mdx`: app structure, runtime layers, and boundaries.
- `routing-and-layouts.mdx`: route model, middleware, and layout rules.
- `auth-and-session.mdx`: authentication flow and session persistence behavior.
- `ui-system.mdx`: UI component principles and Storybook usage.
- `data-and-api.mdx`: API integration model and conventions.
- `state-and-settings.mdx`: settings/state synchronization rules.
- `testing.mdx`: unit/e2e strategy and quality gates.
- `workflow.mdx`: day-to-day development workflow in Docker.

## Storybook

- URL in Docker: `http://localhost:6006`
- Run: `make front-storybook`
- Build: `make front-storybook-build`
- Story docs pages live in `fronted/docs/*.mdx`
- Visual regression scaffold: `.github/workflows/storybook-visual.yml` (requires `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN`)

## Change policy

- Keep docs in this folder updated in the same PR as behavior changes.
- Update Storybook stories when component API or visual behavior changes.
