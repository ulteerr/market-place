# State and Settings

## State model

- Local page state stays in page/component scope.
- Cross-page behavioral state is handled by composables.
- User settings are synced between server and client runtime.

## Current shared areas

- Auth user/token state.
- User UI settings:
  - theme
  - menu collapse
  - admin table/card preferences
  - navigation section open state

## Persistence model

- Auth data persists via cookies.
- Non-auth UI preferences may use local storage where appropriate.
- Server-side settings remain the canonical source for authenticated users.

## Rules

- Do not duplicate the same preference in multiple persistence layers without clear conflict resolution.
- Apply server settings after successful user refresh.
- If auth is lost, clear auth-dependent local UI state safely.
