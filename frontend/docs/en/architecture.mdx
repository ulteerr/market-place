# Frontend Architecture

## Stack

- Nuxt 4 (Vue 3 + composables)
- TypeScript in `script setup`
- SCSS modules per component
- Tailwind (global utilities)
- i18n via `@nuxtjs/i18n`

## Top-level structure

- `pages/`: route-level pages (admin and public).
- `layouts/`: shared shells (`admin` and default).
- `components/`: reusable UI and feature components.
- `composables/`: business logic and API access.
- `middleware/`: auth and access control.
- `i18n/`: localization dictionaries.
- `tests/`: unit and e2e coverage.

## Architectural boundaries

- Pages orchestrate data loading and pass it to components.
- Feature components render feature-specific UI and interactions.
- UI components in `components/ui` are presentation-first and reusable.
- Composables own side effects (API calls, auth/session, settings sync).
- Middleware enforces navigation access rules, not UI business behavior.

## Admin-first strategy

Current implementation priority is admin functionality:

- Users CRUD
- Roles CRUD
- Action logs and changelog tooling
- Profile/settings management

The system is structured so the same UI/data conventions can be reused for public pages later.
