# Testing Strategy

## Test types

- Unit tests: `vitest`
- End-to-end tests: `playwright` (chrome, firefox, webkit profile)

## Commands

- Full frontend test flow: `make front-test`
- Unit only: `make front-npm cmd="run test:unit"`
- E2E only: `make front-npm cmd="run test:e2e"`
- Storybook build check: `make front-npm cmd="run build-storybook"`

## Quality gates

- New business behavior should be covered by at least one automated test.
- Auth/session behavior changes require explicit regression checks.
- Admin navigation and CRUD critical paths should remain e2e-covered.
- Reusable UI components should have Storybook stories with canonical states.

## Storybook and tests

- Storybook documents component behavior.
- Storybook `play` scenarios verify critical UI interactions on component level.
- E2E validates integrated behavior in real routes.
- They complement each other and should evolve together.
