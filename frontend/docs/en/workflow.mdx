# Frontend Workflow

## Daily development (Docker)

1. Start stack: `make up`
2. Frontend app: `make front`
3. Storybook: `make front-storybook`
4. Run tests as needed: `make front-test`

## Dependency changes

- After `frontend/package.json` updates, run:
  - `make front-install`
- This is required for both Nuxt runtime and Storybook runtime in containers.

## Documentation workflow

- Update `frontend/docs/*` when:
  - architecture boundaries change
  - API integration model changes
  - auth/session behavior changes
  - new reusable UI components are introduced
- Add/update Storybook stories in the same change set as UI component changes.

## PR checklist (frontend)

- Feature behavior implemented.
- Unit/e2e tests updated where applicable.
- Storybook stories updated for changed reusable components.
- Storybook docs pages updated when architectural/process context changes.
- `npm run build-storybook` passes locally/in CI.
- `frontend/docs` updated for architectural or contract changes.
